# brython-calculator

This calculator app is developed with intention of playing with Brython app, 
and It is capable of running in the browser using the Python programming language.

>This is not actually Python. it is Brython. 

I heard that Brython is designed to replace JavaScript as the scripting 
language for the Web browsers and Python 3 implementation.

It is adapted to HTML5 environment, which means that It works with the 
DOM objects and events.

## Requirements to run this:

You will need the following:
- Text editor or IDE such as PyCharm, 
- Web Browser such as Mozilla 
- Internet connectivity
